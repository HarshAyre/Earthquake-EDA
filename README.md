# Earthquake-EDA
This project explores global earthquake events from 2001 to 2023, analyzing patterns and trends to gain insights into seismic activity. Using data visualization and statistical analysis, In this I have examined key factors such as magnitude, depth, significance, and tsunami occurrences to understand their impact.  

Analyzed 782 earthquake events worldwide using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.  
* Explored trends in magnitude, depth, significance, and tsunami occurrences.  
* Conducted time-based analysis (year, month, day, hour) to identify event patterns.  
* Visualized quake distribution by country, with a detailed study of the top 3 most affected regions.  
* Handled missing data using logical imputation techniques.  
* Created bar charts, pie charts, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, line plots, treemaps, choropleth maps, and density mapbox maps using 
        Matplotlib, -Seaborn, and Plotly.
